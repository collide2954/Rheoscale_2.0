# RheoScale 2.0
### Description
RheoScale 2.0 (a.k.a. "rheoscale") is a Python-based calculator that identifies overall behaviors for individual protein positions, using their respective sets of amino acid substitutions (e.g., all 19 substitutions at a given position). For each amino acid substitution, a measured experimental value (e.g., enzyme activity, fluorescence, binding, etc.) is input using a CSV file OR is user-input.  For each position, the range and types of outcomes for its substitution set are used to assign one of several classes: Neutral, Rheostat, Toggle, Moderate, Adverse, Enhancing, or WT/inactive. The rheoscale script also generates histograms and a summary output file that can be used for further analyses.
>>Rheoscale2.0 is an expansion of a calculator first published in 2018.  The theory, rationale, and specifics of data analyses utilized in this calculator are explained in more detail in the associated publication:
Hodges, A. M., A. W. Fenton, L. L. Dougherty, A. C. Overholt, and L. Swint-Kruse. 2018. 'RheoScale: A tool to aggregate and quantify experimentally determined substitution outcomes for multiple variants at individual protein positions', Hum Mutat, 39: 1814-26.
>>
>>A citation for Rheoscale2.0 will be forthcoming.


## Usage/Quick Start

Rheoscale2.0 has been implemented 3 different formats. 
1. As a Python Package (this github site)
2. As a Command line interface (CLI; this github site)
3. As an Excel workbook, which can be downloaded at https://github.com/liskinsk/RheoScale-calculator

## About the Calculations

#### Position classes:  
At least 5 amino acid variants are required for each position to be analyzed.  RheoScale first uses the value and error for the wild-type variant to determine whether a position is “neutral” or “non-neutral”.  The variant sets for non-neutral positions are then assessed with a modified histogram analysis. 

The hierarchical logic used to define position classes follows the order: Neutral>Toggle/Enhancing>Rheostat>WT-Inactive_split>Moderate/Adverse.

The descriptions of these position classes, as well as the publications describing their default score thresholds, are:
>>Neutral: At least 70% of substitutions have WT-like outcomes for the parameter measured.  The neutral score for each position, which is used to assign neutral positions, is calculated separately from all other scores, by using a neutral bin that is centered on the wild-type value and is (usually) independent of the histogram bin size.

>>Moderate rheostat: Substitutions have non-neutral outcomes, but the set of substitutions samples less than half of the possible range AND the values are closer to WT than to the "dead" end of the range. If positions are close to the thresholds for moderate, adverse, or WT/Inactive split, the assignment flagged, indicating that a manual inspection of the data is needed to determine the best position class.
Reference: Swint-Kruse, L., T. A. Martin, B. M. Page, T. Wu, P. M. Gerhart, L. L. Dougherty, Q. Tang, D. J. Parente, B. R. Mosier, L. E. Bantis, and A. W. Fenton. 2021. 'Rheostat functional outcomes occur when substitutions are introduced at nonconserved positions that diverge with speciation', Protein Sci, 30: 1833-53.

>>Rheostat: Simplistically, the position's set of substitutions samples at least half of the possible functional range.  When the "weighted" rheostat score is used, the sampling might be a little less than half of the range, but contributions from variants with partial loss-of-function are weighted more heavily, since they provide more confidence that a position is a rheostat position.   The weighted score has been used in almost all studies to date.  Rheostat behavior cannot be detected from the average of a position's substitution values.

>>Adverse:  Like Moderate rheostat positions, substitutions have non-nuetral outcomes and the set of substitutions samples less than half of the possible range.  However, the set of values are closer to the "dead" end of the range than to WT. If positions are close to the thresholds for moderate, adverse, or WT/Inactive split, the assignment flagged, indicating that a manual inspection of the data is needed to determine the best position class.

>>Toggle: Around 2/3 of the substitutions lack detectable activity.
Reference: Miller, M., Y. Bromberg, and L. Swint-Kruse. 2017. 'Computational predictors fail to identify amino acid substitution effects at rheostat positions', Sci Rep, 7: 41329.

>>WT/Inactive split: Half of the substitutions have WT-like outcomes and the other half lack detectable activity.  This may be a hallmark of altered protein stability. These are a special case of "binary" positions (for which substitutions fall in only 2 bins).If positions are close to the thresholds for moderate, adverse, or WT/Inactive split, the assignment flagged, indicating that a manual inspection of the data is needed to determine the best position class.

>>Enhancing: At least 80% of substitutions enhance the measured parameter relative to the upper limit of the neutral bin.

#### Guidelines for histogram analyses: 
a) For linear-scale data that spans 1 order of magnitude, histogram bins should be calculated using non-transformed (linear) calculations.  If a data set covers more than two orders of magnitude, it should be converted to a log scale. Any functional  value that has already been converted to a log scale (e.g., Gibbs free energy) or doesn't cover more than two orders of magnitude (e.g., Hill number) should not be converted. A data set that spans between 1 and 2 orders of magnitude should be carefully considered to determine whether a log scale is appropriate or not.  Note that most high-throughput data (e.g., "deep mutational scanning") are already reported in log scale, and should not be converted.

b) The value that represents a completely nonfunctional protein ("dead") must be defined as either the minimum or maximum value used to analyze the data set. 

c) The default width of the neutral bin is set to 4 times the WT error (or 4 times the error override), to represent the WT value +/- 2 standard deviations. If no error is designated, the default is set to 2 times the rheostat/toggle bin size.  See Martin et al, 2020, for the statistical reasoning.  The width of the neutral bin can also be set by the user.  

d) The histogram range is the most important parameter for assigning position phenotypes. The range is determined from the minimum and maximum values of the dataset and/or known for the assay.  The min and max values of each dataset are calculated automatically.  If a data set is known to have min or max values that differ from the experimental dataset, override values can be entered.  Various examples that require override values are as follows:
-	For datasets with variants that are "better" than wild-type, it can be useful to set the relevant max/min override so that the last bin is populated by at least 5% of the total variants; this prevents a tiny set of highly-active variants from making the range artificially large and thus dominating RheoScale assignments.
-	The max/min override cells are used when the dataset being analyzed spans a smaller range of functional values than is known to be possible (e.g., when the dataset does not contain a “dead” variant.)  
-	The max/min overrides may also be used when investigators wish to designate a “dead” threshold that falls inside the measurable assay range (e.g., any variant with less than 10% activity should be considered “dead”). 
-	Examples for estimating "dead" values are described in the following publications (as well as others from the Swint-Kruse lab):  1.  Hodges, Fenton, Dougherty, Overholt, and Swint-Kruse. 2018. 'RheoScale: A tool to aggregate and quantify experimentally determined substitution outcomes for multiple variants at individual protein positions', Hum Mutat, 39: 1814-26. 2.  Sreenivasan, Fontes, and Swint-Kruse. 2025. 'Dissecting the effects of single amino acid substitutions in SARS-CoV-2 Mpro', Protein Science 34, e70225. 3.  O'Neil, Swint-Kruse, and Fenton (2024) Rheostatic contributions to protein stability can obscure a position's functional role, Protein Science 33, e5075.
-	If any data point falls outside of the max or min override value, it will be reassigned to be the override value for calculations. 

e)  An error override option  is provided for data sets that do not have an error value associated with each functional value.  Alternatively, one error value may better represent the error inherent in the experimental methodology.  This value is used in determining a recommended number of bins for analyzing the data set.  If error override is included for a data set that is converted to a log scale within the calculator, then the error value entered will be propagated using the wild type as the reference value. The formula for error propagation for log calculations in this case is 0.434*error/[WT value]. If an alternate approach to error propagation is desired (percent error, etc) then the user should amend the data set before including in the calculator.

f) The recommended number of bins is determined through a combination of the average error for the data set as well as the total number of variants at each position.  A perfect rheostat position would occupy 20 bins, but error and the number of variants available for each position constrain the number of bins that should be used.  The algorithm for the bin number recommendation c is explained in further detail in Hodges et al., 2018.  If a different number of bins is desired, that number can be entered with an override.  Empirically, 10 bins appear to work well for many datasets. Iterations with different bin numbers show that many position assignments are not very sensitive to the bin number.

g) Weighted versus unweighted rheostat scores.  Unweighted rheostat scores are calculated as the fraction of bins occupied by at least one variant. Weighted rheostat scores take into account the fact that variants that fall in bins farther from the "wild-type" and "dead" bind are more likely to be "true" intermediate outcomes than variants in bins adjacent to "wild-type" or "dead" bins. In default calculations of weighted rheostat scores, bins containing “wild-type” and “dead” values are assigned a weighting value of 1, bins adjacent to the “wild-type” and “dead” bins are assigned a weight of 2, and all other bins were weighted with a value of 3.  The weighted rheostat score is then calculated from the sum of the weighted values of each occupied bin divided by the sum of the weighted values of all bins. The final weighted score ranges from near 0.0 (no rheostat behavior) to 1.0 (perfect rheostat behavior).  The Microsoft® Excel version contains “override” cells for investigator-determined weighting factors.  In the python version, the weighting factors must be changed in the script. In general, the Swint-Kruse group has chosen to use weighted rheostat scores, and the weighted scores are used in RheoScale2.0 to make position assignments.
